**v2.5R1** (November 2021, draft version)
- Version number now located in support.h, published once MQTT connection is available

**Versioning changed**

Released versions are availabe on the [release page](https://github.com/absalom-muc/MHI-AC-Ctrl/releases)
All other versions are draft. A new version ends with "R1", "R2"-postfix etc. before it is released w/o "R"-postfix, e.g. v2.5R1 => v2.5R2 => v2.5
For documentation updates usually no new version number is created.

**v2.3** (September 2021, draft version)

- output of the number of WiFi and MQTT lost since last reset
- output of the BSSID used for the WiFi connection
- use of the strongest WiFi access point (testing incomplete)
- option added to use the room temperature from DS18x20 sensor or from MQTT topic instead of AC IU sensor

- Frequency measurement limits adapted, ESP is halted only when there is a toggle on MISO detected, results of the measurement will be published via MQTT
- some [operating data](https://github.com/absalom-muc/MHI-AC-Ctrl/blob/master/MQTT.md#mqtt-topics-related-to-operating-data) added (MQTT path changed)
- [error operating data](https://github.com/absalom-muc/MHI-AC-Ctrl/blob/master/MQTT.md#mqtt-topics-related-to-error-data) added
- reset via MQTT for ESP8266 added

- Data types of some variables adapted
- MQTT status will be published after broker was down
